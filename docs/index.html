	<h1>Inertia Simulation</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the inertia simulator! Jump between frames of reference and watch the same physical event transpire from two different perspectives at the same time! This sandbox is designed to allow you to customize your own scenarios and observe them play out from an inertial ("stationary") and non-inertial (accelerating) frames of reference. Start off by adding the forces you want to include in your scenario, whether that be Gravity, Thrust, Tension Friction, Air Resistance, etc. These forces may be expressed as functions of position (x, y), velocity (vx, xy), and time (t), including functions of said variables such as cos(x) or sqrt(vy) to allow for support of a variety of different forces and force fields. Once you have added all the forces you want to include, you can then add the bodies you want to include in your scenario. Each body can be assigned an initial position vector (0,0 is the center of the screen) and an initial velocity vector. From there, you may select forces you wish to apply to said bodies and then once you are ready hit stard simulation.
